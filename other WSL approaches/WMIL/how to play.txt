Install the wmil-sgd github: git clone https://github.com/idiap/wmil-sgd.git

This github has been written in Python 2.7 - we just modify the print commands adding brackets (wmil_sgd.py)

Run the pipelinee_wmil_binarized.py having made the necessary actions:

 - 'top_100_labels.txt' or the .txt with the investigated labels
 - 'PH_x_train_embeddings_top_100_labels_100k_200k_numpy_vectors.pickle' --> numpy vectors of the biobert embeddings per sentence
 -  The corresponding files for the selected mode (e.g. mode 3)
 	- 'indices_100k_mode_3.csv' 
 	- 'y_weakly_top_100_075_3.pickle'

 We have to select the parameters of the main function: model = SGDWeights(ada = 0.25, alpha=0.4, momentum=0.25, minib=5)
 The selection was made so as to find some positive answers for the trainign set for at least some labels. Towards this direction, we made a balanced training dataset.

Two pickles are produced, one for the training stage and one for the testing one, writing also the last one into a .csv file.
